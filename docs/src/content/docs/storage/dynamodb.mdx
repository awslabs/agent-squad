description: Using Amazon DynamoDB for persistent conversation storage in the Agent Squad System
---

DynamoDB storage provides a scalable and persistent solution for storing conversation history in the Agent Squad System. This option is ideal for production environments where long-term data retention and high availability are crucial.

## Features

- Persistent storage across application restarts
- Scalable to handle large volumes of conversation data
- Integrated with AWS services for robust security and management
- Automatically replaces key-value pairs for sensitive data to control how values are anonymized during save and restored during retrieval from DynamoDB

## When to Use DynamoDB Storage

- In production environments
- When long-term persistence of conversation history is required
- For applications that need to scale horizontally
- When sensitive data anonymization is a requirement

## Python Package

If you haven't already installed the AWS-related dependencies, make sure to install them:

```bash
pip install "agent-squad[aws]"
```

## Implementation

To use DynamoDB storage in your Agent Squad:

1. Set up a DynamoDB table with the following schema:
   - Partition Key: `PK` (String)
   - Sort Key: `SK` (String)
   - Additionally, you can also set up your DynamoDB table with:
     - **TTL Key** to automatically delete older conversation items
     - **Sensitive Mappings** to anonymize sensitive data during processing. Sensitive mappings involve providing a dictionary of key-value pairs where keys represent sensitive strings and values represent their anonymized versions.

2. Use the DynamoDbChatStorage when creating your orchestrator:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="runtime">
  <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript" color="blue">
    ```typescript
    import { DynamoDbChatStorage, AgentSquad } from 'agent-squad';

    const tableName = 'YourDynamoDBTableName';
    const region = 'your-aws-region';
    const TTL_DURATION = 3600; // in seconds
    const dynamoDbStorage = new DynamoDbChatStorage(tableName, region, 'your-ttl-key-name', TTL_DURATION);
    const orchestrator = new AgentSquad({
      storage: dynamoDbStorage
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
    ```python
    from agent_squad.storage import DynamoDbChatStorage
    from agent_squad.orchestrator import AgentSquad

    table_name = 'YourDynamoDBTableName'
    region = 'your-aws-region'
    TTL_DURATION = 3600  # in seconds
    dynamodb_storage = DynamoDbChatStorage(table_name, region, ttl_key='your-ttl-key-name', ttl_duration=TTL_DURATION)
    orchestrator = AgentSquad(storage=dynamodb_storage)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Anonymization

The DynamoDbChatStorage now supports sensitive data anonymization. You can provide a dictionary of sensitive data mappings to replace specific strings with anonymized values in chat messages. This feature applies to both saving and retrieving conversations.

**Example**

If your sensitive mappings are defined as:

<Tabs syncKey="runtime">
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
    ```python
    from agent_squad.storage import DynamoDbChatStorage
    from agent_squad.orchestrator import AgentSquad

    SENSITIVE_MAPPINGS = {
      "AWS": "CloudProvider",
      "Nova": "LLM"
    }

    TTL_DURATION = 3600  # in seconds

    dynamodb_storage = DynamoDbChatStorage(
      table_name='YourDynamoDBTableName', 
      region='your-aws-region', 
      ttl_key='your-ttl-key-name', 
      ttl_duration=TTL_DURATION, 
      sensitive_mappings=SENSITIVE_MAPPINGS
    )
    orchestrator = AgentSquad(storage=dynamodb_storage)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- When saving a message containing "AWS", it will automatically be stored as "CloudProvider".
- When retrieving the message, the storage will reverse the anonymization and return "AWS".

## Configuration

Ensure your AWS credentials are properly set up and that your application has the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table.

## Considerations

- Requires AWS account and proper IAM permissions
- May incur costs based on usage and data storage
- Read and write operations may have higher latency compared to in-memory storage
- Ensure sensitive mappings are comprehensive to cover all data requiring anonymization

## Best Practices

- Use DynamoDB storage for production deployments
- Implement proper error handling for network-related issues
- Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data to optimize performance
- Regularly backup your DynamoDB table to prevent data loss
- Define and manage sensitive data mappings to ensure compliance with data privacy requirements

DynamoDB storage offers a robust and scalable solution for managing conversation history in production environments. It ensures data persistence and allows your Agent Squad System to handle large-scale deployments with reliable data storage and retrieval capabilities.
